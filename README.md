# Friday Night Funkin' x Jake
### By Jake!

---

This mod was created as a potential 'out of nowhere' mod. This is no submission for anything, I made this because I was bored, I potentialy wanted this to be a sudden joke mod, but I have no idea what just goes on in my head sometimes!

---

> Why does this mod exist? I know, the game's popularity... Nah, it was just pure boredem!

**NOTICE**: This mod was made using the **Kade Engine 1.7**, I may or may not have plans to port this mod to other engines...
