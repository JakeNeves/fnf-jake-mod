:dad:WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?
:bf:Geez...
:bf:You didn't have to shout at us bro...
:bf:And what happened here?
:dad:Two strangers were about to viciously attack me...
:bf:damn!
:dad:Those vicious demon guys stood no chance...
:dad:They were armed with a machetti and a razor-wire baseball bat!
:dad:So in the act of self-defense, I took out a knife that I had brought with me...
:dad:And I stabbed them both eighteen times, before I was aware of you guys coming here.
:bf:So that explains that murder scene behind you...
:dad:Yes...
:dad:Those hitman were apparently "hired" by someone to kill me...
:bf:That almost sounds like the time my girfriend's dad tried to kill me.
:dad:Really?
:bf:Yeah...
:bf:Anywho, wanna have a rap battle again?
:dad:Fine, but just one more... I think someone is after me!
